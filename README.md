# signal-plotting
plotting signals in python practice
To plot this signals one has to first install python,matplotlib and numpy in their system

Q1.When plotted in the complex plane for !π + ω + π, the function f (ω) =cos(ω) + j0.1 sin(2ω)  results in a so-called Lissajous figure that resembles a two-bladed propeller.
(a) In PYTHON, create two row vectors fr and fi corresponding to the real and imaginary portions of f (ω), respectively, over a suitable number N samples of ω.
Plot the real portion against the imaginary portion and verify the figure resembles a propeller.

Q2.Use PYTHON to plot the function x(t) = t sin(2πt) over 0 <= t <= 10 using 501 equally spaced points. What is the maximum value of x(t) over this range of t?

Q3.Use PYTHON to plot x(t) = cos (t) sin (20t) over a suitable range of t

Q4.Use PYTHON  to plot x(t) = ∑(k=1 to k=10) cos (2πkt) over a suitable range of t.

Q5.Use PYTHON to represent the function x(t) = e ^ -t

Q6.use python to plot x(t) = sin(2π5t) for 0<=t<=2π

Q7.use python to plot the signal x(t) = e^t sin(2π5t)

Q8.plot the signal f(t) = sin (2π10t + π/6)

Q9.Determine an expression for a sinusoid that oscillates 15 times per second, that has a value of -1 at t = 0, and whose peak amplitude is 3.
Use PYTHON to plot the signal over 0<=t<=1. x(t) = 3sin(2π30t)
